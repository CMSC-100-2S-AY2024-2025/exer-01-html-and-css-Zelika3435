Steps on how to create GitHub page:
- First, create a repository in github
- Next, clone the repository into your personal computer
- Then, create/input your project files in the repository
- Add, commit, and push changes in the cloned repository
- Finally, go to your github repository and publish it under the pages category
- You now have the link to your GitHub page

The main takeaway I have from this exercise is that I could publish a website for free using github. I was ignorant to that information before this exercise. It helps open up possibilities and options in the future.
